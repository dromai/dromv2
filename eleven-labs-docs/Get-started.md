## What is Conversational AI?

ElevenLabs [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) is a platform for deploying customized, conversational voice agents. Built in response to our customers' needs, our platform eliminates months of development time typically spent building conversation stacks from scratch. It combines these building blocks:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Speech to text">
    Our fine tuned ASR model that transcribes the caller's dialogue.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Language model">
    Choose from Gemini, Claude, OpenAI and more, or bring your own.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text to speech">
    Our low latency, human-like TTS across 5k+ voices and 31 languages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Turn taking model">
    Our custom turn taking model that understands when to speak, like a human would.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Altogether it is a highly composable AI Voice agent solution that can scale to thousands of calls per day. With [server](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/server-tools) & [client side](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/client-tools) tools, [knowledge](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/knowledge-base) bases, [dynamic](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/dynamic-variables) agent instantiation and [overrides](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/overrides), plus built-in monitoring, it's the complete developer toolkit.

<Card title="Pricing" horizontal>
  15 minutes to get started on the free plan. Get 13,750 minutes included on the Business plan at
  \$0.08 per minute on the Business plan, with extra minutes billed at \$0.08, as well as
  significantly discounted pricing at higher volumes.
  <br />
  **Setup & Prompt Testing**: billed at half the cost.
</Card>

<Note>
  Usage is billed to the account that created the agent. If authentication is not enabled, anybody
  with your agent's id can connect to it and consume your credits. To protect against this, either
  enable authentication for your agent or handle the agent id as a secret.

| Enterprise | Custom pricing         |

### Pricing during silent periods

When a conversation is silent for longer than ten seconds, ElevenLabs reduces the inference of the turn-taking model and speech-to-text services until voice activity is detected again. This optimization means that extended periods of silence are charged at 5% of the usual per-minute cost.

This reduction in cost:

- Only applies to the period of silence.
- Does not apply after voice activity is detected again.
- Can be triggered at multiple times in the same conversation.

## Models

Currently, the following models are natively supported and can be configured via the agent settings:

| Provider      | Model                 |

subtitle: Build your first conversational AI voice agent in 5 minutes.
---

In this guide, you'll learn how to create your first Conversational AI voice agent. This will serve as a foundation for building conversational workflows tailored to your business use cases.

## Getting started

Conversational AI agents are managed through the [ElevenLabs dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai). This is used to:

- Create and manage AI assistants
- Configure voice settings and conversation parameters
- Equip the agent with [tools](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools) and a [knowledge base](/docs/conversational-ai/customization/knowledge-base)
- Review conversation analytics and transcripts
- Manage API keys and integration settings

<Note>
  The web dashboard uses our [Web SDK](/docs/conversational-ai/libraries/react) under the hood to
  handle real-time conversations.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Testing your assistant">
         Press the **Test AI agent** button and try conversing with your assistant.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    ### Analyze and collect conversation data
    
    Configure evaluation criteria and data collection to analyze conversations and improve your assistant's performance.
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure evaluation criteria">

        Every conversation transcript is passed to the LLM to verify if specific goals were met. Results will either be `success`, `failure`, or `unknown`, along with a rationale explaining the chosen result.
    
        Let's add an evaluation criteria with the name `solved_user_inquiry`:
    
        ```plaintext Prompt
        The assistant was able to answer all of the queries or redirect them to a relevant support channel.
    
        Success Criteria:
        - All user queries were answered satisfactorily.
        - The user was redirected to a relevant support channel if needed.
        ```

        Click **Add item** and configure the following:
    
        1. **Data type:** Select "string"
        2. **Identifier:** Enter a unique identifier for this data point: `user_question`
        3. **Description:** Provide detailed instructions for the LLM about how to extract the specific data from the transcript:
    
        ```plaintext Prompt
        Extract the user's questions & inquiries from the conversation.
        ```
        <Tip>Test your assistant by posing as a customer. Ask questions, evaluate its responses, and tweak the prompts until you're happy with how it performs.</Tip>
    
      </Step>
      <Step title="View conversation history">
        View evaluation results and collected data for each conversation in the **Call history** tab.

## Overview

The Agents Dashboard provides real-time insights into your Conversational AI agents. It displays performance metrics over customizable time periods. You can review data for individual agents or across your entire workspace.

## Analytics

You can monitor activity over various daily, weekly, and monthly time periods.

The dashboard can be toggled to show different metrics, including: number of calls, average duration, total cost, and average cost.

## Language Breakdown

A key benefit of Conversational AI is the ability to support multiple languages.
The Language Breakdown section shows the percentage of calls (overall, or per-agent) in each language.
